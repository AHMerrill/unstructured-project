# [Launch Anti Echo Chamber App](https://unstructured-project-xlzf4hh2vay9gsnrychgms.streamlit.app/)

Explore ideologically diverse coverage of current topics — compare how different outlets frame the same event and visualize stance polarity in real time.

---

Builds an embedding index of news and commentary for studying topic framing and sentiment polarity across sources.  
This repository handles scraping, embedding, batching, and coordination for the Hugging Face dataset [`zanimal/unstructured-project`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zanimal/unstructured-project).

# Anti Echo Chamber: Scraper and Embedding Pipeline

This repository implements the complete pipeline used to collect, classify, and embed full-text news articles for the Anti Echo Chamber project.  
The goal is to construct a dataset and retrieval engine that can surface *contrasting arguments* on the same topic by comparing both **topic similarity** and **stance divergence**.

---

## 1. System Overview

The pipeline operates in modular stages defined in `config.yaml`.  
It processes free, factual sources such as *Reuters* and *The Guardian UK* to create dual embedding spaces:  
- one for **topic**, capturing what each article is about  
- one for **stance**, capturing how it argues or frames the issue  

Additionally, the stance module cross-references each article’s tone with **its outlet’s known bias** using `source_bias.json` to determine whether the piece aligns with, opposes, or diverges from its usual ideological framing.

---

## 2. Stage Breakdown and Models Used

### Stage 1. Collection

**Purpose:** Download and structure full articles and metadata from accessible RSS feeds or Selenium scrapes.

**Libraries and Tools**
- `feedparser`, `requests`, `trafilatura`: RSS and HTML parsing
- `BeautifulSoup4`: fallback DOM extraction
- Configurable list of sources, using outlet definitions in `source_bias.json`
- Output fields: `source`, `url`, `title`, `date`, `author`, `section`, `content`

---

### Stage 2. Topic Embedding

**Purpose:** Encode semantic topics for clustering and retrieval.

**Model:** `intfloat/e5-base-v2`  
**Embedding Dimensionality:** 768  
**Pooling:** mean  
**Chunk Tokens:** 512  
**Normalization:** true  
**Collection:** `news_topic`

**Method:**
- Each article is chunked into ≤512 token windows.
- Each chunk is embedded using E5 and averaged to a single topic vector.
- Related topics are mapped using the taxonomy in `topics.json`.
- Topic overlap is detected via cosine similarity ≥ 0.4.

---

### Stage 3. Stance and Ideological Classification (LLM)

**Purpose:** Classify the article’s political leaning, implied stance, and rhetorical framing.

**Provider:** OpenAI  
**Model:** `gpt-4o-mini`  
**Temperature:** 0.4  
**Max Tokens:** 256  
**Mode:** `llm-classification`  

**Inputs:**  
- Cleaned article text  
- Reference ontologies:  
  - `political_leanings.json` (macro ideological families)  
  - `implied_stances.json` (policy-specific positions)  
  - `source_bias.json` (outlet bias metadata)

**LLM Prompt Behavior:**
1. Summarizes the article’s argument in one concise sentence.  
2. Assigns:
   - `political_leaning` (e.g., center left, libertarian, populist right)
   - `implied_stance` (e.g., pro regulation, market environmentalism, austerity)
3. Compares the output to the outlet’s **bias_family** and **bias_score** in `source_bias.json`.

**Tone Alignment Logic**
- If stance and tone are consistent with the outlet’s expected bias, the article is labeled **in-bias**.  
- If the stance significantly diverges (e.g., right-leaning argument in a left-leaning outlet), it is labeled **counter-bias**.  
- If no consistent match exists, it is **neutral or mixed**.

Example output:
```
{
  "political_leaning": "center left",
  "implied_stance": "pro regulation",
  "summary": "Argues that public oversight is necessary to keep markets fair.",
  "tone_alignment": "in-bias"
}
```

The OpenAI response is then combined into a unified text block for embedding.

---

### Stage 4. Stance Embedding (Hybrid)

**Purpose:** Create dense embeddings representing worldview, tone, and rhetorical stance.

**Model:** `all-mpnet-base-v2`  
**Concatenation Order:** `[political_leaning] + [implied_stance] + [summary]`  
**Max Length:** 4096 characters  
**Pooling:** mean  
**Collection:** `news_stance`

This “hybrid text” captures ideological direction and emotional framing in one consistent vector space.

---

### Stage 5. Storage and Dataset Export

**Local Database:** `ChromaDB`  
- Directories: `chroma_db/`  
- Metric: cosine distance  
- Collections:
  - `news_topic`
  - `news_stance`
- Automatic rebuild if missing.

**Batch Artifacts:**
- `embeddings_topic.npz`
- `embeddings_stance.npz`
- `metadata.jsonl`
- `manifest.json`
- Optional compression and push to:
  [Hugging Face Dataset: zanimal/unstructured-project](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zanimal/unstructured-project)

---

## 3. RSS Expansion

You can extend coverage by adding new RSS feeds.

```python
FEEDS = [
    "https://www.reuters.com/rssFeed/worldNews",
    "https://www.theguardian.com/world/rss",
    "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/rss"
]
```

Each article will automatically flow through cleaning, classification, embedding, and ChromaDB insertion.

Output record format:
```
{
  "source": "guardian",
  "url": "...",
  "title": "...",
  "date": "...",
  "content": "...",
  "topic_vector": [...],
  "stance_vector": [...],
  "tone_alignment": "in-bias"
}
```

---

## 4. Selenium Scrape Ingestion

For pages requiring dynamic rendering, create a DataFrame with:

| column | type | description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| source | str | outlet identifier |
| url | str | canonical link |
| title | str | headline |
| date | str | ISO date |
| content | str | article body |
| author | str (optional) | author |
| section | str (optional) | category |

Then run:
```python
from pipeline import process_dataframe
process_dataframe(df)
```
This triggers classification, embeddings, and tone-bias alignment exactly as the RSS path.

---

## 5. Cross-Bias Comparison Logic

The analysis tool identifies ideological contrast across outlets and within outlets.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1. **Topic Matching**
   - Retrieve top-N articles by cosine similarity in `news_topic` (same subject).

2. **Stance Divergence**
   - Compute cosine distance in `news_stance`.
   - Large distance ⇒ opposite tone or worldview.

3. **Bias Contrast Evaluation**
   - Combine stance and tone alignment metadata.
   - Highlight pairs where:
     - Both discuss the same topic, and  
     - One is *in-bias* and the other *counter-bias* relative to their sources.  

Example:
- Input: Guardian article labeled *center left*, *pro regulation*, *in-bias*
- Retrieval: Wall Street Journal article labeled *center right*, *pro market*, *in-bias*
- Both map to “Economy / Regulation” topic  
→ flagged as a **contrast pair**

**Libraries Used**
- `chromadb` (dense retrieval)
- `numpy` (cosine similarity)
- optional `faiss` for scale

---

## 6. Logging and Diagnostics

- Logging level: `INFO`
- Failure records saved to `logs/`
- Every 100 records checkpointed
- Embedding validation checks:
  - Non-zero vectors
  - JSON integrity
  - Tone alignment computed successfully
  - Sample preview limited to 500 chars for manual inspection

---

## 7. Contributor Notes

- Only scrape open, legal text (Guardian, Reuters, AP, BBC, etc.).
- Do not upload paywalled or copyrighted content.
- Verify that each record includes valid text, stance, and tone alignment before embedding.
- When adding new sources, include their bias metadata in `source_bias.json` so the tone alignment logic remains accurate.
